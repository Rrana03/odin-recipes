        <p><em>An easy weeknight seafood dinner.</em></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Â¼ cup butter</li>
            <li>2 (8 ounce) whole trout, butterflied and deboned</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat
                until butter smells toasted and is golden brown,
                about 1 minute. Turn off heat.
            </li>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with a piece of aluminum
                 foil. Place trout onto foil; open trout so 
                 skin sides are down. Drizzle each trout with
                  about 1/2 teaspoon melted butter. 
                  Generously season with salt and black 
                  pepper.</li>
            <li>Move an oven rack to 5 or 6 inches 
                    below the heat source and preheat the 
                    oven's broiler on high heat.</li>
            <li>Broil trout until opaque and barely firm to
                 the touch, 2 or 3 minutes. Remove from oven.
            </li>
            <li>Return pan of remaining melted butter over 
                high heat; stir in lemon juice and parsley. 
                Bring butter sauce to a boil; whisk to 
                combine. Serve trout on plates and drizzle 
                with butter sauce.</li>
